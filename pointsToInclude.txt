0ms timer caused optane to blow up - aggEngine wasn't doing anything
Adding 10ms time improved latency

App direct mode v slow for aggengine

How fast are raw insert? 

Is it fast at loads of concurrent queries while getting written to?

RDB - very far behind 

NOTE - RDB latency would be even more prevelant with optane if feed wasn't using .z.p at run time.. it'd be miles behind
